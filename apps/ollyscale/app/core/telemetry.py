"""OpenTelemetry telemetry setup

Note: When running in Kubernetes with the OpenTelemetry Operator,
auto-instrumentation is injected automatically via the Instrumentation CR.

Auto-instrumented components (no manual setup needed):
- FastAPI HTTP requests/responses (opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi)
- Redis operations (opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis)
- Logging with trace context (opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging)

This module only provides domain-specific metrics for OllyScale operations.
