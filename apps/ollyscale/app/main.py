# OllyScale API - Lightweight OpenTelemetry Observability Backend

OllyScale is a lightweight OpenTelemetry-native observability backend built from scratch
to visualize and correlate logs, metrics, and traces. Perfect for local development.

## Features

* 📊 **Traces** - Distributed tracing with span visualization
* 📝 **Logs** - Structured logging with trace correlation
* 📈 **Metrics** - Time-series metrics with full OTLP support
* 🗺️ **Service Map** - Auto-generated service dependency graphs
* 🔍 **Service Catalog** - RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)

## OpenTelemetry Native

All data is stored and returned in standard OpenTelemetry format, ensuring
compatibility with OTLP exporters and OpenTelemetry SDKs.

## Note

This is the API backend. The web UI is served by the ollyscale-ui nginx container.
